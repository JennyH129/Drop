## The Game
This is a remake of Bejeweled. The goal of the game is to swap two gems that are next to each other in order to form chains, in order to collect points. A chain is defined by three or more consecutive gems that are the same color. The chains that are formed will be destroyed and replaced randomly with new chains. There are also some special gems that can destroy all gems of the same color, or all the gems in a row or column. 

## The Instructions
Press w, a, s, or d and then hit enter to move your cursor. Press e to select the gem that the cursor is on. Select two gems that are next to each other to swap them.

Swaps are only allowed if they result in a chain. Moves are only counted if they result in a valid swap. There are a maximum of 100 moves before the game ends.
